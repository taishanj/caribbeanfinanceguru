Personal Financial Advice Web App 

This is a PHP based project that was an attempt to create an automated personal financial advisor for the Caribbean. It contained a Financial Health Check that would take some of your basic Demographic details and give you clear targets and ratings on : 1-Savings 2-Life Insurance 3-Income

Did not get the kind of traction I hoped for to press on with it. To date there were less than 20 users in the space of one year (after which I am giving up the domain caribbeanfinanceguru.com)
